# Guesser-game
This Game is Completly Designed on the concept of Object Orientation in Java.
While Object Orientation is nothing but the perspective of looking at the real world as a Collection of Objects.
And it is derived with the help of 5 principles :
While this Game has 5 Objects: Guesser, Umpire, and 3 Players.

And in rotational, the Umpire calls 3 players to match the number with the Guesser...
If the number matches with the Guesser then the Umpire Calls.....so on so the Player has won the Game
If the number doesn't match the Guesser then the Umpire Calls ....the Player has lost the Game.

With the above 5 principles and the Steps, I have stated and executed this game with successful output.
